### **Writing Documentation in Rust: The Basics**

One thing I love about Rust is its excellent documentation system. It's built right into the language, and turning your comments into beautiful docs is as simple as adding a few extra characters. Let me show you how it works.

### **Simple Doc Comments**

In Rust, we use `///` for documentation comments. Here's a quick example:

```rust
/// Adds two numbers together
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```
/// let result = add(2, 2);
/// assert_eq!(result, 4);
/// ```
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

### **Module Documentation**

For documenting entire modules, use `//!` at the start of the file:

```rust
//! This module handles all mathematical operations.
//! 
//! # Features
//! - Basic arithmetic
//! - Unit conversions
//! - Error handling
```

### **Quick Tips**

1. **Testing Your Docs**
   ```bash
   cargo test --doc
   ```
   This runs all the code examples in your documentation!

2. **Generate Documentation**
   ```bash
   cargo doc --open
   ```
   Creates and opens your docs in the browser.

### **Documentation Best Practices**

- Always include examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep it simple and clear
- Test your code examples

### **That's It!**

Documentation doesn't have to be complicated. Start with these basics, and you'll be writing great docs in no time. Remember, good documentation makes your code more useful for others (and future you)!
